### 0.19.1

This release _really_ removes support form "marked" as a free text
matcher on WebViews.

Also, the rect:x and rect:y JSON returned by queries on WebViews
now (correctly) indicate the top left corner of the element.
Previously, rect:x and rect:y referred to the _center_.  This is
breaking change.  After a long discussion, we decided that this is
a long standing _bug_ rather than a change in the API; an API change
would require a non-patch release.

* WebQuery: rect x and y should indicate the top-left corner of the
  element #354
* Increment LPTestTarget CFBundleVersion for every build #352
