## The Calabash iOS Server

http://calaba.sh

The companion of the calabash-ios gem:  https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios

### Building the Framework

```
$ make framework
```

### Building the frank plugin

```
$ make frank
```

### Building the dylibs

Building the dylibs requires that you inject xcspecs directly into your Xcode.app application bundle.  For instructions, refer to the link below.

You will also need to update the code signing Build Settings of the `calabash-dylib-device` target with your credentials.

```
make dylibs
```

Dylibs support is based on this article:

### Building to embed in Calabash gem

See the calabash-ios/calabash-cucumber/Rakefile for more details.

```
$ cd path/to/calabash-ios/calabash-cucumber
$ rake build_server

# If you need to build without the dylibs
$ CALABASH_NO_DYLIBS=1 rake build_server
```
